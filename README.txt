This program converts text files to EGI Net Station RAW files.

Initial codebase is for PowerPC, some work to update for Intel processors (endian stuff).

This program is particularly useful for generating your own data to later test different tools on.  For example, you can easily test filters on square waves.  

./NSImporter <output> <input1> <input2> <inputX> -C <category1> <category2> <categoryX>

Enjoy!
